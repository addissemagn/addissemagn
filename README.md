### Hi, I'm Addis ♪٩(✿′ᗜ‵✿)۶♪

I'm a Software Engineer at [Cash App](https://cash.app).

I studied Computer Engineering at the [University of Toronto](https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/).

During that time, I did 5 back-to-back internships as a Software Engineer at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) (Fall '21), [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) (Summer '21), [Square (Cash App)](https://cash.app) (Winter '21), [Uplift Inc.](https://uplift.com) (Fall '20) and [RelayPay](https://relaypay.io) (Summer '20), spanning 20 months.
